            <p style="font-family:roboto !important;"><b class='fs-5'>Kashmirzakat.com</b> is a one-of-its-kind Social Crowdfunding platform floated by the Sahuliyat Kashmir Voluntary Trust (SKVT)  with a view to bring the Zakat Seekers and Zakat Givers on a unified platform. 
            Its objective is to undertake its operations purely with the intent of bringing socio-economic transformation in the lives of the people, without seeking to generate any commercial surplus. 
            Zakat is a mandatory charity which Muslims are obliged to pay if wealth is above a threshold limit in a year. 
            Although most people dispense the necessary Zakat amount, it is unorganized to a great extent.
            Such unorganized disbursement isnâ€™t a sustainable solution to the backwardness of the community. 
            Therefore, SKVT has decided to undertake an initiative for implementation of a collective system of Zakat. 
            This platform, KashmirZakat.com is a step in the direction of mobilizing the collection of Zakat, Sadqa, Fitra and other charities in a collaborative way and channelize these collections for providing benefits to the poor and backward sections of the society for their overall survival, upliftment, development and growth.</p>
